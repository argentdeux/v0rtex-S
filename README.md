# v0rtex-S for <10.3

A work in progress jailbreak, using Siguza's [v0rtex](https://github.com/Siguza/v0rtex) kernel exploit.

Currently, we have:
 - r/w kernel access
 - r/w on '/' (root dir, aka disks1s1)
 - AMFI/codesigning patch, hence the ability to run unsigned code
 - SSH access (with included binaries)

Fat creds to stek on the r/w and amfi stuff, and originally xerub too.

Thanks to EthanRDoesMC for the logo, Sigzua for the exploit, xerub for libjb, and cheesecakeufo for help with entitlements.
Please let me know if you believe I have used your work without appropriate creditation; I will ensure to fix it immediately. 

### Offsets

Offsets are currently WIP. We will be updating with new offsets for as many devices as possible ASAP.

The offsets used are for iPhone 7 on iOS 10.3.1 and must be changed if that's not what you're using.

Offsets for iPhone 6S (iPhone8,1) 10.3.2 are also included, however you will have to be a big boy and switch them out yourself in the v0rtex.m file.

To find your own offsets read [this guide](https://gist.github.com/uroboro/5b2b2b2aa1793132c4e91826ce844957).

There are a few new offsets you will need to find:

**OFFSET_ROOT_MOUNT_V_NODE**: ```nm <kernelcache> | grep -E " _rootvnode$"```

**OFFSET_CHGPROCCNT**: This offset references the string ```"chgproccnt: lost user"```

**OFFSET_ROP_LDR_X0_X0_0x10**: Simply search for ```000840f9c0035fd6``` in hex.

**OFFSET_KAUTH_CRED_REF**: This can be found in the symbols table ```nm <kernelcache> | grep kauth_cred_ref```

### Requirements

Xcode and a device running iOS 10.3.x.
